# Space Stitch

This is a really simple app to keep track of Crochet stitching.

## Parsing
- It uses Chevrotain.io library for parsing
- You can copy/paste app/parse.js into https://chevrotain.io/playground/

## Developing
- This Nextjs 13/14 app is an excuse to play with the App router.
- I'm following https://mael.app/blog/nextjs-13-app-directory-prisma-3nnl/ to 
  learn how to use Prisma directly with the app router.


## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Building
